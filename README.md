# COMPARISON - PICTOGRAM
### 12 - 9 - 21

This is a pictogram comparing the highest grossing films from 1995 - 2021

This was created with a simple python algorithm contained in ```pictogram-comparrison.py```
Below is a screenshot, however the pdf version enables better zoom to truly appreciate the scale of this project!
